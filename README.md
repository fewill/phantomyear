# The Phantom Year 👻

A website exploring a fascinating calendar phenomenon where dates create a perfect numerical symmetry—and collectively form a hidden "year within a year."

## What is the Phantom Year?

The Phantom Year (also known as the Fractal Year) occurs when the calendar day perfectly matches the year in the format DD/MM/YY (where DD = YY). For example: **January 26, 2026** → 26/01/26.

## The Mathematical Discovery

This pattern only exists from **2001 to 2031**—the first 31 years of the 21st century. After 2031, it becomes mathematically impossible until the next century.

The most remarkable finding: When you count every occurrence of this pattern across these 31 years, the total equals exactly **365 days**—one complete year scattered throughout the century.

### The Breakdown

- **2001-2028**: 12 matches per year (every month) = 336 days
- **2029-2030**: 11 matches per year (no February 29/30) = 22 days  
- **2031**: 7 matches (only months with 31 days) = 7 days
- **Total**: 365 days
